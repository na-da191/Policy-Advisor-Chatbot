"Lets say the life policy holder dies, has life insurance and there are 6 beneficiaries listed, which were all living during and after the death. One of the beneficiaries dies two weeks later. What could happen her portion of the money?

";"Let's say the six beneficiaries are to receive a benefit of $600,000 in insurance proceeds, and each one gets $100,000.
In the case of the beneficiary who dies shortly thereafter, her $100,000 will be treated as she had requested before her death. The proceeds will go to her living trust only if she had requested that they be used in that manner; if not, her $100,000 goes to her estate. If it causes the estate value to exceed the exemption threshold, then it is taxed. As far as secondary beneficiaries go, they are a non-factor in this scenario, as all primaries took part in receiving the benefit.";
Do I Need To Have Life Insurance Before My Child Does?;"1.) Are you covered by a group policy at work? If so, will proof of that coverage work for the agent you are attempting to purchase your child's insurance from? Or, can you/have you added the child to your work policy? Not the best option if you were to leave work, but coverage nonetheless.
2.) Knowing that most companies are going to want to sell you a policy first, perhaps you look at securing a term policy for yourself - one that will not break your budget, but satisfy the requirements needed to be able to purchase the policy for your child. If you look at an ROP (Return of Premium) term policy, you might even be able to structure it in a way that helps you out with permanent coverage as well. Either way, a term policy will be a short term, less expensive way to cover the both of you.
3.) You might look at getting a policy for yourself, and adding your child on a rider (a clause added to the contract that provides additional benefits) to insure them as well for a period of time. That way you provide protection for your child, and provide coverage for them as well.
4.) You could take a few moments and look at your State's Department of Insurance website, and see what exactly the minimums/requirements are (good luck with that, maybe the coffee hadn't kicked in yet, but I found New York's fairly unhelpful). Then work between them.
I would look for an independent agent, and run your needs by them. I would be very open about your desire to seek a second opinion if the agent cannot come up with a viable solution for you. I promise you there is one. Thank you for asking your question, and for looking into providing for your child in a responsible and loving way. You rock! Good luck, and don't hesitate to contact me if you need any help.";

If you have found an issue in the policy terms or values contact your agent and get it resolved before that dispute period runs out, because after that you are bound by the policy's terms;
What Does Short Term Insurance Cover?;"Short-term health insurance covers major medical expenses, the ER, Urgent Care visits, along with office visit and prescription drugs. Depending on the carrier, there may be a deductible, coinsurance, or copay that applies to specific benefits. Inpatient and outpatient surgeries are also covered, along with typical expenses that are associated with hospital claims.

Rates are typically very inexpensive, since not all ACA Legislation-mandated coverage is included. However, temporary plans provide cheap stop-gap coverage when three months (or less) of benefits are needed. If longer periods of coverage are needed, you can re-apply for an additional policy, although underwriting is typically required.

Many larger insurers offer this type of coverage, which may be ideal if you miss the Open Enrollment deadline. However, if eligible for Medicare or Medicaid, this option should not be considered.";
